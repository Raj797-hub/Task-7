# Extension Security: Research Notes

## 🔐 What I Learned
- Browser extensions can collect data like:
  - Websites you visit
  - Keystrokes or clipboard content
  - Passwords or cookies

- If you give them permission to “read and change all your data on websites,” they can do a lot in the background.

## 🧠 Common Signs of Suspicious Extensions
- Very few downloads or no reviews
- Asking for permissions unrelated to their function
- Redirecting websites or slowing down the browser

## ✅ Safe Usage Tips
- Install only from trusted sources like Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons
- Check reviews and screenshots before installing
- Remove any extension you don’t recognize or use often
- Read what permissions it asks before clicking “Add”

## 🧷 Good Tools to Help
- Chrome’s built-in “Review Permissions” tool
- Extension report systems on Chrome Store
- Manual check using chrome://extensions > Details
