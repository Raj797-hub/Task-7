# Task 7: Suspicious Browser Extension Check

## 🧭 Task Overview
This task was about checking all browser extensions and removing anything that looked unnecessary, suspicious, or unsafe. It helped improve awareness of browser-based risks and how extensions can affect security.

## 🧪 What I Did
- Opened my browser extension page using chrome://extensions
- Checked what each extension does, its reviews, and permissions
- Found one that was not useful and removed it
- Took screenshots before and after to show what changed

## ❌ Extension Removed
- *Dark Theme – Dark mode for web*  
- This extension inverted the color of every website, even those already in dark mode. It didn’t improve usability and caused some websites to look broken.  
- Removed to reduce clutter and avoid bad browsing experience.

## 💡 What I Learned
- Extensions can be a privacy risk if they request too many permissions
- It’s important to review them regularly and only keep ones that are needed
- Extensions that look helpful can sometimes do more harm than good

## 📂 Files Included
- removed_extensions.txt — Details of the extension I removed
- research_notes.md — Extra info I found about extension security
- screenshots/ — Before and after images
